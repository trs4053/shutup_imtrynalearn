#### Video no.107 : Binary search algorith

Binary search algorith is an algorithm used to find an element in a sorted array. It halves the search areaof the array at every step untill it reaches the desired value. The steps of the algorithm are:

1. Start searching at the middle element of the array.
2. If the desired value is greater than the middle value, then the search area will be halved from middle element to last element. if the desired value is lower than the middle value then the search area will be halved from the 1st element to the middle element.
3. Keep halving the area like shown in step 2 untill the desired value is found.

This algorith has a logarithmic time complexity. So it can run efficiently for a large array.


### Video no.33: Web assembly

WebAssemby is a compiler target for programmes written in language like C, C++, which is converted into a binary format and can be run on a web browser. 
1. Webassembly allows applications written in languages other can javascript to run on web browsers. It removes the need of installing an application on a device.
2. WebAssembly does not replace javascript. It allows for browsers to run programs that javascript cannot run. Like building a game with unity in C and compilig it in WebASSEMBLY will allow it to run on browser.
3. Emscripten is a compiler that compiles C and C++ to WebAssembly.


### Video no.61: Software testing

Software is dynamic, it needs to be changed with time- to upgrade functionalities and more efficiency. A software needs to be tested to check if the code fulfills the requirements of the product and check for defects.

1. Manual testing: A human manually checks every function of a code and assigns jira tickets for the developers(Jira is an event that must be investigated or a work item that must be addressed). This process is slow and not very efficient for large programs.

2. Automated testing: Developers write code to test the main program code. A test program ends with .test or .spec extension.
- Test suite: The features which are being tested. May contain 1 or more individual test.
- In an individual test, there is a description of the test, following the code to be tested and expected results from the code. The test fails if expectation returns false.
- There are many testing strategies, like unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing to test a function, a block of function or a complete code.

### Video no.37: Websocket

Websocket is a computer network protocol which allows bidirectional communucation between a client and a server for real time data exchange between server and client. It bypasses the need for refreshing or polling the webpage. 

1. The client sends a request to establish a ws connection
2. The server responses with 101 switching protocol and the connection is establishesd. This is called handshake(for some reason i don't know).
3. When a connection is established, both the serever and the browser is coded to send and recieve message.
